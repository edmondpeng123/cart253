1.The first art jam that I will be discussing is Norah’s work. It’s a fun self-portrait representing what seems to be, at first glance, a fox, but after further discussion with Norah, it really is instead a cat. She’s been enjoying illustrating people as animals as shown in her sketchbooks and past projects in her drawing course, which is why she decided to create this representation. I appreciate the overall design of the character and the way the shapes are simple, yet so nicely constructed together. There’s a great balance in terms of its colors and the composition of the self-portrait. The interactivity is, again, straightforward, but effective. Making the circle into an eye following a bee is a clever, cute and smooth idea. Sometimes, I wonder if it would look more like a cat if it had whiskers or a little triangle nose, but for some odd reason, the frugal aesthetic of the animal just simply works so well. 

2.The second art jam is Leah’s project called Stardrops. Leah portrays hundreds of mini glowing stars as a self-portrait, visualizing her constant growth and her more whimsical and unserious approach to life. The stars are randomly generated in different colors from an array of colors. They are slowly dropping faster and faster as time goes by. At some point, they go so fast that the web is not able to pick up on the frames and all stars just seem to flicker intensely which I found funny, but also overstimulating. The change of speed is rather slow and barely noticeable when you pay careful attention to it, it only becomes more obvious when you step away from it and look back after a couple of minutes. I find this distinction quite intriguing as it reminds me of our personal growth and how change sometimes creeps up on you without you ever noticing it. It’s only when you finally step away to reflect; that you realize how time flew past, how time has changed, and so did you. It’s an overall beautiful and dreamy art jam that I enjoyed looking at.

3.The third and last art jam is Ahmad’s self-portrait. He portrays himself outside, slowly blinking while the sky’s getting darker. His arm follows the mouse and you can wave around with it. After he blinks, his eyes start to become red. Ahmad says that he didn’t really think of a concept and just wanted to experiment with time constraints which I found to be well-executed. The character design itself was quite simple and cartoon-like. I appreciated the fact that I barely noticed the sky changing colors because I was so focused on the blink animation. What made me disconnect is the abrupt change of the moon which I found disrupted the flow of the animation. Overall, I thought it was still a fun project and I enjoyed discussing about the potential meaning of his portrayal with him.
