Edmond Peng's Mod Jam Response

Abhi's mod jam is a fusion of early 2000s game culture and Iphone game culture, implementing old Pokemon soundtracks from the GameBoy era as well as the Pokemon fighting sequence which is also reminiscent of that time period. One of the characters is quite literally Flappy Bird which was, to me, a nostalgic trip back to 2013 when it became a world-wide phenomenon. Playing Abhi's game appealed to my childhood in unforgettable ways in terms of the sounds, the aesthetic, the simplistic game mechanic and the overall pixelated visuals. However, if I allowed myself to be critical, I would argue that the mini-game through the frog's perspective eating Flappy Bird is way too easy and I didn't find it quite as engaging as the other bird's perspective option. To make it more fun, I would've maybe randomized the speed of the birds, or make it faster as the game progresses, add more birds or something along those lines just to add more spice. That being said, I find it so amusing that you can play both characters and have both perspectives. I can imagine a game where both mini-games are fused and a second player controls the other character with a score to make it more competitive.

Norah's mod jam is a well-executed game with a simple mechanic that works smoothly. Everything about her mod jam is so aesthetically pleasing and feels very complete. I've had the chance to talk to her about her project and she told me that she created all of the pixel art using Aseprite which is super impressive. The sound effects combined with the pixel assets reminds me of modern age pixel games such Terraria and Stardew Valley which again, is so stunning. For me, what really makes her project come to life is the little subtle animations of the frog eating the fly complemented by the frog tongue sound effect. If I had to put on my critical hat, I would speak on the overall game mechanic which wasn't too engaging in itself, although the other visual/sound add-ups really did compensate for that fact, and, in retrospect, the speed of the fly is fast enough that it isn't entirely easy to catch it and the time does go down quite fast if I'm not careful, so the difficulty levels seems to be adequate. In truth, the only thing I would add is just a restart button at the end of the game to smoothen the restarting process and keep the player more engaged in some form.

Felix's mod jam allows the player to customize their frog by having a color section for it and a tongue color selection which is so fun and makes me feel more emotionally connected to the frog. I personally went with the green frog and a blue tongue to spice things up. The game starts by making the frog lick the start button, fully keeping us engaged and giving a little preface on the nature of his game. I love the sound effects added at the release of the tongue as well as when it eats the fly. The different patterns in which the flies fly also makes the game difficult enough. I also noticed that the more combo you have, the tongue grows bigger which makes the game easier, at some point, it does become quite easy because the tongue just got so much bigger, but as soon as you lose focus, even once, and hit the spiky vines; you immediately lose all of your combo and the tongue goes back to its initial size. I find this detail to be very amusing and a fun little twist on the game mechanic. Overall, I'd say that the game mechanic is most likely the strongest point of his project and the customization just makes it more fun and is reminiscent of Iphone games. What could be fun is to integrate those customization colors into how you perform in the game itself; for example, if the player wins x amount of times, he can acquire new colors or something.
