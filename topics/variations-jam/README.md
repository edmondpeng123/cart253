## Description

A playful web exploration on the experience of an anxious student getting through his Design degree while dealing
with different sorts of difficulties.

Design of Anxiety is a web platform that holds three mini-games inspired by the struggles of an anxious design student. 

Rumination (Imposter Syndrome) is a game where the player has to avoid random anxious thought bubbles that are appearing at different speeds and if they get hit by too many, then their mental health deteriorates until they mentally burn out and the game stops.

Microsoft (Pain)t is a counter-intuitive rudimentary drawing tool that attempts to emulate the feeling of confusion when learning a
design software for the first time. The user can play around the keys and create art for fun.

Design ethos? is a searching game that makes reference to the stress that design students undertake as they enter their final year
and have to rethink their career path, their purpose, their design ethos. They have to find purpose as many times as possible before time
runs out.
