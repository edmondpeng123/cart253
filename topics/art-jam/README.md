# Fragments of the Self

## Description

This project is a representation of our fragmented self-image within the digital space. The user can interact with each bitmapped bubbles by hovering the mouse on them and triggering different types of effects.

## Screenshot(s)

Each assets are photos that I took on my camcorder and transferred into Photoshop to apply a bitmapped effect; I then took out the white background using color range to make it translucent and emphasize the layering of each bubbles - further pushing the narrative of deconstruction or construction of identity on the web.
