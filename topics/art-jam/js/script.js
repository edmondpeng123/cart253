/**
 * Mirror of Fragments
 * Edmond Peng
 * 
 * 
 * I want to make several petal shaped forms (fragment) all rotating around a circle; each petal shaped form will be an image 
 * that is associated with my own perception of the self whether it be physical, psychological or anything visually or 
 * emotionally represented. They will all rotate at different rhythms and overlap one another. When you move your mouse to a fragment, 
 * it will make it grow bigger so that you can observe better but it will start to blur until it becomes indistinguishable. The petals
 * is a visual representation of different facets of my individual although not directly referencing them; they flow in fluctuating
 * rhythms to highlight its ever-changing quality and they all rotate around an invisible circle which represents the core/soul.
 * The blurred effect of holding unto a petal is to replicate the ephemeral and, again, ever-changing quality of how I may
 * associate things/body/ideas to my being, but may also lose them over time.
